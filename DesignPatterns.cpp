//01. Strategy Pattern
/*
Using composition rather than inheritance. This pattern defines a family of 
algorithms, and encapsulates these algorithm and make them interchangeable.
This pattern let the algorithm work very independently from the client who use 
it. 
*/


//02. Observer Pattern
/*
We define the observers as the classes who need to observe a frequently changed 
class Observable class. Whenever the observable makes the change, it will push 
the information that it has changed to all the observer classes.

The observer pattern defines an one to many dependency between objects, 
that when one of the objects changes the states, all of its dependencies are 
notified and updated automatically.
*/


//03. Decorator Pattern
/*
A decorator pattern attaches an additional responsibility to an object 
dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for 
extending functionality.
*/
//Case: 
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<queue>
