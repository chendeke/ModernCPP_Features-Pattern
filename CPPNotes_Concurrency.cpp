Principles to avoid deadlock:
1. Prefer locking single mutex at a time!

2. Avoid locking a single mutex and calling a user provided funtion!
e.g. 
{
	std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(mu);
	user_function(); //No!
}
The reason is that user function may lock other mutex or even lock the same mutex
again!

3. Using std::lock() method to lock multiple mutexes if you really want to!

4. When std::lock() is impossible, try to lock the mutexes in the same order for all
threads!

Locking Granularity!
- Fine-grained lock: protects the small amount of data!
- Coarse-grained lock: protects the large amount of data!
